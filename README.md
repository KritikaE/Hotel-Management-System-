# Hotel-Management-System-


**Project Overview:**

This project is a detailed Software Engineering analysis of a Hotel Management System (HMS), focusing on the foundational design and architecture using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The objective is to formally model the system's requirements, structure, and behavior to serve as a blueprint for development.


**Key Artifacts Included:**

The primary deliverables of this project are the core UML diagrams, which model different aspects of the HMS:

Use Case Diagram: Defines the scope of the system and identifies all primary actors (Guests, Receptionists, Managers) and the key functions they perform (e.g., Check-in, Book Room, etc).

Class Diagram: Illustrates the static structure of the system, showing the main classes (e.g., Room, Guest, Booking, Invoice), their attributes, operations, and the relationships between them (associations, inheritance, aggregation).

Sequence Diagrams: Details the time-based interaction between objects for critical workflows, such as:

Room Booking Process

Guest Check-In

Activity Diagram: Models the flow of control and sequential steps involved in complex business processes, such as the overall reservation and payment workflow.

Component Diagram: Provides a high-level view of the system's structural components and their dependencies (e.g., Frontend UI, Booking Service, Database).



This project serves as the foundational design phase for the Hotel Management System software development lifecycle.
